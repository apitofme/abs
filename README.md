Awesome Bash Scripts (a.k.a ABS)
================================

ABS is a collection of useful bash scripts for a variety of purposes, from simplifying and automating certain actions to programmers tools and more! It's not quite a framework, and many of the scripts are design to be stand-alone so that people are able to simply install what they need.

It is currently both a *'work-in-progress'* and a learning project so I'm happy to accept suggestions, requests or contributions as I try to learn and understand more about shell scripting.

----------------------------------

Currently planned scripts include:

Utility Scripts:
- 'mkvhost'	>> Auto generate a vhost config file (currently for Apache on Debian*esque* systems but will eventually include more!)
- 'addhost'	>> Add an entry to the system's *hosts* file
- 'chall'	>> File/Folder permissions tool that rolls *chown*, *chgrp* and *chmod* in to one!
- 'extract'	>> An all in one archive utility that can handle *zip*|*tar*|*gzip*|*bz2*|*7zip*|*rar* etc. (assuming the relevant program is already installed!)

Programmers Tools:
- 'harray'	>> Array functions (inc. *push* / *pop* and *shift* / *un-shift*)
- 'hlog'	>> Logging/Debugging functions
- 'hprompt'	>> User prompts
- 'haction'	>> Interactive user prompts (user actions)
